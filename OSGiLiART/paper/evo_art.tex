\subsection{Aesthetic measures for evolutive art}

{\bf Definition} Two modes of aesthetics measures can be defined \cite{galanter2012computational}: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item {\em Aesthetics evaluations are expected to imulate, predict or cater to humans notions of beauty and taste.} 
\item {\em Is an aspect of meta-aesthetic exploration and usually involves aesthetic standards created by software agents in artificial worlds.}
\end{enumerate}

According to Galanter \cite{galanter2012computational}, computational aesthetics measures can be classified in the following categories:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Based on Formulaic and Geometric Theories. The aesthetics of a piece of art are evaluated using a formula o principle (e.g., pythagorean proportions).
	\item Based in Design Principles. Like the rule of thirds or theory of color (e.g., opposite colors) \cite{den2012evolving}.
	\item Based in Neural Networks and Connective Models. 
	\item Based in Evolutionary Systems:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Interactive Evolutionary Computation. The fitness of the individuals is determined by human agents.
			\item Performance based goals. Certain properties of the art piece are evaluated and optimized based in performance measures (e.g., usable surface in furniture design generator).
			\item Error relative to Exemplars. The individual fitness is measured using a real-world example (e.g., a photography or painting). \cite{dipaola2009incorporating}
			\item Complexity measures. This type of measures is based in the idea the complexity is directly related to aesthetics \cite{li2012investigating}.
			\item Multi-objective. Given the multidimensional nature of aesthetics judgement, multi-objective EAs are a clear option in order to deal with this multidimensionality.
			\item Extensions to EA (such as, coevolution, agent swarm behavior, etc.).
		\end{itemize}
	\item Complexity Based Models
\end{itemize}
